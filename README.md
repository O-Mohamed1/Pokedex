# Pokedex
Pokedex API

Built during Vincent's free youtube coding bootcamp. He taught me about APIs and how to take the data recieved and display it. I used that info to get data from a separate API link and display pokemon descriptions when an image is clicked. Also added a results navbar to allow users to change the limit of results given from the API.
